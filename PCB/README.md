# From Altium With Love
## Description
A hearth shaped PCB with LEDs, showing a few, predefined patterns of colors. I made it for my girlfriend.
When its powered up, LEDs will made some fancy patterns of colors.
## Powering
It's powered from 5V adapter, but there is no input socket (only pads to solder) because I wanted to fit this in a photo frame.
## TODO
* Maybe more patterns 
* Voice modulated colors
